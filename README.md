This is the source code for my website [https://www.jaredhowland.com][1]. I use [Jekyll][2] to dynamically generate static files, eliminating the need for server-side scripting languages or databases. I can write all my content in [Markdown][3], have an XML sitemap automatically generated, and easily change the look of the site with the templating system. See the [Jekyll site][2] if you are interested in learning more.

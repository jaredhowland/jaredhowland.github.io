![Slide 1][1]

* I’d like to start this afternoon by sharing a story I heard a couple years ago on the NPR program “This American Life”
* You will be hearing from Alex Blumberg, the producer of the program:

![Slide 2][2]

* This story illustrates the problems that are inherent in making assumptions
* Assumptions are the biggest challenge facing libraries today
* Alex’s embarrassing experience was based on a set of faulty assumptions
* How many of you attended the North American Serials Interest Group (NASIG) meeting in 2008?
* For those of you that attended, please indulge me as I summarize on of the keynote presentations for the next 4 or 5 minutes
* That presentation, given by Mike Kuniavsky, was, for me, the genesis of the project I will be discussing today
* This summary will be about three-fourths summary and one-fourth my interpretation of his presentation
* So, Mike Kuniavsky spoke at the NASIG 2008 annual conference about ubiquitous computing
* However, he started by analogizing the world of electric motors to the world of computing

![Slide 3][3]

* In 1910, “electric motors were expensive, so you bought one for the house and then you bought attachments for it. The motor was a general purpose tool that was adapted as needed.”
* As motors got cheaper, you started having multiple motors in the home
* Instead of an attachment for a fan, you had a fan
* Instead of an attachment to wash clothes, you had a washing machine
* Eventually, we ended up with hyper-specialized electric motors (for example, there are now, on average, 20-30 motors per car)
* This led to many unintended consequences (vacuums → wall-to-wall carpeting)
* We see the same thing happening with computers today as what happened with electric motors at the turn of the century
* We have entered the 3<sup>rd</sup> stage of computing (mainframe → desktop → ubiquitous computing)
* The phrase ubiquitous computing was phrased in 1988 by Mark Weiser
* He describes it as follows:

![Slide 4][4]

* The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.
* Just like hyper-specialization of the electric motor led to some interesting changes, so will ubiquitous computing
* Mike Kuniavsky continued by saying the following:

![Slide 5][5]

* Ubiquitous computing gives us tools to track, trade and share objects much more efficiently than any previous technology.
* What does this mean in real terms?
* Here are just a few real world examples:

![Slide 6][6]

* You are all familiar with Netflix
* Ubiquitous computing has led to a tracking system that allows for cheap and easy movie rentals and, now, even movie streaming
* This model is challenging the way we think about ownership of movies
* Why would you need to own a movie when you can just stream a movie straight to your TV anytime you want to watch it (you don’t even need to get out of our chair to put in the DVD)
* Here’s another example:

![Slide 7][7]

* Another example is ZipCar – rent a car anytime you need one
* This is a very different idea of ownership than what we are used to
* Mike described it as living in a world where everything has dotted lines around it
* Instead of owning a car, you own the right to use a car
* The idea of subscribing to something instead of owning it is, of course, nothing new to librarians
* We have dealt with serials and aggregators for many years now
* However, with the advent of ubiquitous computing, the possibilities for what we can have access to without having ownership are almost endless
* It was not financially feasible to do this even just a few years ago, however, today we can get access to entire libraries

![Slide 8][8]

* In the past, the words access and ownership were synonymous in the library world – those two terms were inextricably entwined
* There was no way for librarians to provide access without owning the material
* Interlibrary loan changed that to a certain extent
* However, it has only been since the advent of ubiquitous computing and the network that access and ownership have been truly decoupled
* Going back to Alex Blumberg and his assumptions about Nielsen families, the biggest assumption librarians are now questioning is that we must own content in order to provide research-quality resources
* Just how far will this idea go?

![Slide 9][9]

* How many resources are really so critical to a research library’s mission that we must own them?

![Slide 10][10]

* And how many of our resources would it be okay for us to just have access to them?

![Slide 11][11]

* In other words, the big question is ownership vs…

![Slide 12][12]

* access
* There is no one-size-fits-all answer
* However, access, rather than ownership, may be the best answer in many cases in the future
* Finding the optimal mix (the right answer) all depends on where we are willing to see dotted lines in our world
* But most of all, it depends on how willing we are to go back to the assumptions we made about Nielsen families as a kid and really start to question them
* So, it was with these ideas in mind that I created a tool to help our library analyze the overlap we had in our journal collection
* I should probably start with a brief background so you know what type of institution Brigham Young University is

![Slide 13][13]

* BYU is an ARL library with an FTE of about 30,000
* Our serials budget is around 5 million dollars
* Our serials have traditionally been paid out of a common pot of money
* Our collection development coordinator, with the help of subject librarians, is the one that determines the distribution of that pot of money
* As might be predicted, this lead to a “Tragedy of the Commons” problem and has created some inefficiencies in the way the serials budget is handled
* The other problem with our serials is that many librarians have not traditionally viewed library databases as an actual part of our collection
* Sure, they are a nice addition, but they are not the collection
* This has started to change over the last few years and has allowed us to move forward with a project like this

![Slide 14][14]

* So I keep mentioning this project, I should probably give a brief description of the purpose of this project
* Like all libraries, we have access to many of our journals in multiple formats
* We subscribe to some titles in both print and electronic formats and then, we also have access available to us through library databases and aggregators
* We wanted to eliminate this overlap by looking at where and how we had access to all our journals
* For this project to be successful, we needed to have all of the following information:
  1. Price/Budget information - how much were we paying for access to these various journals and what budget were they being paid from
  2. Usage information - how much were the electronic and print versions of our journals being used
  3. Overlap information - where each journal was accessible to our patrons and what were the dates of coverage

![Slide 15][15]

* I will spend the next few minutes describing where I got this information from and then talk about how I used that information
* First, I needed to have a list of journals that our library paid for individually (this included some that were purchased as packages such as Elsevier or Wiley, but the point is that we needed a list of titles for which we received itemized invoices for which Elsevier and Wiley both provided for us)
* The easiest place to get this information was our ILS system
* After talking to our database administrator, he was able to generate a report from our system that included all the titles we paid for, along with how much we paid, what budget it came out of and the ISSN of the titles

* These are savings without losing access to content
* From the patron’s point of view, we are providing the same level of service
* We are just doing it much more cheaply

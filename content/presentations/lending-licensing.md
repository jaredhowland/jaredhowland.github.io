* Primary Research Group just published a study on library database licensing trends
* In it, it had some interesting figures related to ILL and licensing of eContent
* 3 out of 4 libraries surveyed have not tried to renegotiate their database licenses to allow for ILL lending

![Slide 003][3]

* Only 42% said they even keep records for their licensing

![Slide 004][4]

* If you library is like ours, we have seen a steep drop in print acquisition and just as steep climb in electronic acquisitions of serials
* Print: blue
* Serials Purple.
* As more and more titles are going digital, we will all have a harder time filling journal and ebook requests if 3 out of 4 libraries do not try to get rights to lend electronically
* In essence, interlibray loan as a service would not only suffer but would be in danger of irrelevance
* Jared’s going to talk about what we can be doing at our institutions to be more proactive about licensing eContent for ILL

![Slide 005][5]

* Step 1: Find out who licenses resources for your library
* Their office will look like this

![Slide 006][6]

* Step 2: Find out if your licensing guru is asking for lending rights
* If not, request that lending rights be requested every time a license is negotiated

![Slide 007][7]

* Step 3: Offer example language for lending rights
* Example language can be found in what is called the “Standard License Agreement”
* Specifically, the URL here has an example license agreement that includes favorable lending language on pages 2–3

![Slide 008][8]

* Step 4: Start tracking your license agreements
* Preferably using an Electronic Resource Management System (ERM), but anything is preferable to nothing
* If your licensing guru is already tracking this, find out how you can access and use this data
* Step 5: Do not, as a policy, prohibit electronic lending
* Instead, find ways to lend – restructure, redesign do whatever you need to
* Work with your licensing person to find out the best way to find out what lending rights are available
* Step 6: Work with cataloging to make sure records of electronic content that can be lent are loaded into OCLC

![Slide 009][9]

* So the question is, once you find the few titles you can’t lend…how do you just deflect them and not everything?
* Wouldn’t it be great if there was a way to only deflect those individual titles but not everything else?

![Slide 010][10]

* There is a way!
* Our friends in the MARC world thought of it a long time ago
* Character 20 on a 0-20 scale in the 008 field of the MARC Holdings record will designate an item Will Lend, Will Not Lend, Will Lend Hard Copy Only, Limited Lending Policy, or Unknown
* For those non catalogers in the room, what does this mean?

![Slide 011][11]

* This is how it SHOULD work in ILLiad:
* It should make your library a non-supplier for just that item…not everything
* What actually happens is it allows you to select the library but the borrower gets an autodeflect notice: Autodeflection: request type

![Slide 012][12]

* Or if you use OCLC resource Sharing:
* It makes you a non-supplier of that item, at the bottom of everyone’s custom holdings

![Slide 013][13]

* In reality, however, this is how it really works:
* You are still totally visible and show up as a supplier but then the requesting library gets a deflection notice: Auto-Deflection: request type

![Slide 014][14]

* Other option: don’t send up holdings for those journals. That’s what we do…our journals do not even show up – those that we can’t lend

![Slide 015][15]

* Conclusion:
* We need to ask our vendors for ILL privileges
* We need to keep track of the license agreements
* We need to either deflect only those titles we can’t lend, or possible just not send up our holdings for those items until we intend to lend

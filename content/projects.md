# Projects
A more complete list of my projects can be found on my [Vitae][1].

## [Data Management System][6]
### 2017–Present

I have been working on creating and implementing a system to store and use data to help the library evaluate and assess our collections in an organized and meaningful way. I presented the results of this project at a national conference and at a multi-national North American conference.

## Collection Development Suite
### 2017–Present

I am working on a Collection Development Suite that I proposed as a significant enhancement and expansion of the Collection Development Database to consolidate collection development tools for subject selectors assessing their collections. When complete, this will be a significant contribution to the library community as it will show what is possible with current data and systems and open doors to new ways of evaluating collections.

## [UALC Resource Tracking System][5]
### 2017–Present
I created a system for the Utah Academic Library Consortium (<span class="caps">UALC</span>) to track licensing, pricing, usage, and other data about the resources licensed for consortia members. Before undertaking this project, this information was not readily available to consortium members. I originally built this to help the <span class="caps">HBLL</span> track collection development projects.

I presented this to <span class="caps">UALC</span> who then decided to use this as the system to track important consortial purchases and licenses. Unique contributions include creating custom templates and add-ons for the WikiMedia software, which the system was based on, that allows administrators of the system to update information and have it propagate to other pages so information is always up to date.  

## [Scopus <span class="caps">PHP SDK</span>][4]
### 2017–Present

Scopus is an abstract and citation database created by Elsevier. It incorporates important bibliometric data about publications (journal articles, books, and other published materials) to help researchers find high-quality research. It is also used to help researchers determine the relative strength of the publications they wish to submit manuscripts and to track various measures of quality of their existing publications.

This unofficial <span class="caps">PHP SDK</span> makes it easy for institutions to integrate the quality metrics into their websites, personal vitae, and institutional repositories. As of 7 December 2018, this has been used in at least 18 projects at various institutions. <a class="watch btn" href="https://github.com/HBLL-Collection-Development/scopus-api"><i class="icon-github"></i> View Project on GitHub</a>

## [Journal Assessment Tool][2]
### 2009–Present

I created a database that allows us to determine the number of places we have access to all our journals. We can see overlap and cancel subscriptions without losing access to any content. I have built, rebuilt, and redesigned the system multiple times since 2008 and it is an ongoing project that requires maintenance and time to find the best data available. I presented this at the Electronic Resources and Libraries Conference and have received requests from multiple libraries to learn more about the system. <a class="watch btn" href="https://github.com/HBLL-Collection-Development/journals"><i class="icon-github"></i> View Project on GitHub</a>

## [Facebook Application][3]
### 2009

I created a Facebook application that searched ScholarSearch and allowed for manipulation of the results by saving to a folder. This project has been discontinued because of privacy problems involving Facebook's development requirements and changes to the library's system over the years.

## Mobile Web Application
### 2009

I created a version of the library’s website optimized for use on an iPhone and other modern mobile devices that was subsequently used as the official library mobile site. It has since been replaced by a library <span class="caps">IT</span>-created responive version of the library's website.

## Mozilla Firefox Library Toolbar
### 2006–2017

I publicly released a toolbar for the Mozilla Firefox browser that allows patrons to search the library catalog and databases, reserve group study rooms, request materials through Interlibrary Loan and check library holdings from Amazon.com listings. This project was discontinued after significant changes were made to the library's system making maintenance of this project redundant with integrations built into the website.

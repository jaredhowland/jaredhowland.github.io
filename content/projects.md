# Projects
A more complete list of my projects can be found on my [Vita][1].

## [Journal Overlap Database][2]

I created a database that allowed us to determine the number of places we had access to all our journals. This allowed us to see overlap and cancel subscriptions without losing access to any content.

## [Facebook Application][3]
I created a Facebook application that searches ScholarSearch and allows for manipulation of the results by saving to a folder.

## Mobile Web Application

I created a version of the library’s website optimized for use on an iPhone and other modern mobile devices that was subsequently used as the official library mobile site.

## [Mozilla Firefox Library Toolbar][4]

I publicly released a [toolbar][4] for the Mozilla Firefox browser that allows patrons to search the library catalog and databases, reserve group study rooms, request materials through Interlibrary Loan and check library holdings from Amazon.com listings. <a class="watch btn" href="https://github.com/jaredhowland/HBLL-Toolbar"><i class="icon-github"></i> View Project on GitHub</a>

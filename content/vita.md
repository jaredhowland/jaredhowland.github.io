## Creative Projects  ##

### Ongoing ###
* **Data Management System**: 2017–Present  
Creating a system to store and use data to help us evaluate and assess our collections in an organized and meaningful way.
* **Collection Development Suite**: 2017–Present  
Serving on a committee that is developing a Collection Development Suite that I proposed as a significant enhancement and expansion of the Collection Development Database to consolidate collection development tools for subject selectors assessing their collections.
* **Journal Assessment Tool**: 2009–Present  
Created a database that allowed us to determine the number of places we had access to all our journals. This allowed us to see overlap and cancel subscriptions without losing access to any content. Additionally, assessment information such as impact factor and usage is included in the tool.

### Past Projects ###
* **<span class="caps">UALC</span> Resource Tracking System**: 2017–2018  
Created a system for the Utah Academic Library Consortium (<span class="caps">UALC</span>) to track licensing, pricing, usage, and other data about the resources licensed for consortia members.
* **Unofficial Scopus <span class="caps">PHP SDK</span>**: 2017  
I wrote an unofficial <span class="caps">PHP SDK</span> for the Elsevier Scopus <span class="caps">API</span>. This has been shared on Github for other libraries to use and has been used in at least 18 projects in other institutions (as of 7 December 2018).
* **Journal Retention and Cancellation**: 2016–2017  
Working with campus community and the Library <span class="caps">IT</span> department to create a process for collectively and collaboratively deciding on which journals to retain and which to cancel. Writing extensive resources and communications to ensure everyone is up-to-date on the latest information.
* **<span class="caps">OCLC</span> Web Services Library Wrapper**: 2014–2017  
I wrote a library wrapper to make it easier for the library community to use <span class="caps">OCLC</span> web services.
* **Fund Code Web Service**: 2015  
I created a web service to track fund code assignments to subject librarians and to map call numbers to the fund code they are most likely associated with.
* **Lettering Software**: 2014  
Created lettering software that significantly increased the throughput capability of lettering and allowed us to finish a media reclassification process months sooner than would otherwise have been possible. This has been shared on Github and is available for other libraries to use.
* **MARC Record Loader**: 2013  
Created a system that allowed loading MARC records into the library’s ScholarSearch system which significantly streamlined the process and essentially eliminated patron reports of problems with records in the system.
* **Book Assessment Tool**: 2012–2013  
Creating a database that is the corollary of the journal assessment tool for the library’s eBook collection.
* **Barcode Generating Service for Auxiliary Storage**: 2011  
I created a system to streamline the process of moving materials to Auxiliary Storage by allowing the easy creation of barcodes for shelves and the pseudo-patrons needed to manage materials housed in Auxiliary Storage.
* **Collection Development Database**: 2007–2010  
Proposed and planned the development of a collection development database that will aid in various collection development activities including budget allocation and viewing collection development patterns.
* **MetaLib Implementation**: 2009  
Implemented MetaLib, a federated search tool for the <span class="caps">LDS</span> Business College Library, <span class="caps">BYU</span>-Idaho Library and <span class="caps">BYU</span>-Hawaii Library.
* **License Agreement Electronic Repository**: 2006–2009  
Used the D-Space system to store all license agreements, invoices and various communications with vendors which allowed for searching for individual license agreements and made it easier for the University Copyright Licensing and Interlibrary Loan Offices to find out about all of the library’s licensed rights for electronic resources.
* **RSS Feed for New Electronic Resources**: 2009  
Created an RSS feed that automatically updates with the electronic resources that have been added to the library’s A–Z page in the last 3 months.
* **Facebook Application**: 2009  
Created a Facebook application that searched ScholarSearch and allowed for manipulation of the results by saving to a folder.
* **iPhone Web Application**: 2009  
Created a version of the library’s website optimized for use on an iPhone and other modern mobile devices that was subsequently used as the official library mobile site.
* **MetaLib Implementation**: 2008  
Implemented MetaLib, a federated search tool for the Harold B. Lee Library.
* **Verde Implementation**: 2008  
Implemented Verde, an electronic resource management (<span class="caps">ERM</span>) tool for the Harold B. Lee Library, <span class="caps">LDS</span> Business College Library, <span class="caps">BYU</span>-Idaho Library and <span class="caps">BYU</span>-Hawaii Library.
* **<span class="caps">SFX</span> Implementation**: 2007  
Implemented a Journals A–Z list and an OpenURL link resolver for the Harold B. Lee Library, <span class="caps">BYU</span> Law Library, <span class="caps">LDS</span> Business College Library, <span class="caps">BYU</span>-Idaho Library and <span class="caps">BYU</span>-Hawaii Library.

Created an <span class="caps">HBLL</span> Research Mac OS X Widget that allowed patrons to search the library catalog, databases, journal finder and Google Scholar.
* **Mozilla Firefox Library Toolbar**: 2006  
Released to the public a toolbar for the Mozilla Firefox browser that allows patrons to search the library catalog and databases, reserve group study rooms, request materials through Interlibrary Loan, and check library holdings from Amazon.com listings.
* **Cascade Mountain High School Library Project**: 2005–2007  
Set up the library on an open-source automated library system, trained staff on copy cataloging, and gathered donations of materials for the library’s collection.
* **Management Tools for Databases A–Z List**: 2005  
Created system to allow for recording of information on back-end of Databases A–Z list such as the sponsor of the resource, when the resource was added to the A–Z list and whether or not the resource is a paid subscription.

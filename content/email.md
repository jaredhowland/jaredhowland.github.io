# The Problem
Email takes too long to respond to, resulting in continuous inbox overflow for those who receive a lot of it.

# My Solution
Treat all email responses like text messages, using as few words as possible to communicate the message.

This is a personal policy that all email responses, regardless of recipient or subject, will be as short as possible. It’s that simple and is not intended to be rude or dismissive.
